# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-07-06
### Added
- **PWA & Offline Readiness**: Added `manifest.ts` and `next-pwa` configuration to support local installation and caching.
- **Offline Machine Spirit**: Added offline support in `useScan.ts`, allowing users to optionally skip the backend and use the local on-device K-Means engine.
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Added comprehensive `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing.
- **Automated Tests**: Added Python API tests (`test_auth.py`) to verify the new Analytics Admin Key enforcement.
- **Consent Banner**: Added a non-intrusive toast-style consent banner (`ConsentBanner.tsx`) to manage telemetry opt-in for analytics.
- **Dynamic Exit-Intent Feedback**: Implemented interruption stacking in `useFeedbackPrompt.ts` with a 30s delay, firing once per session to improve UX without being annoying.
- **Metadata Generation**: Added dynamic OpenGraph image generation (`opengraph-image.tsx`) and enhanced Twitter metadata tags for `/convert` routes.

### Changed
- **SEO & Layout**: Completely overhauled the Paint Hub pages (`/paints/[brand]/[slug]`) with double-auspex branding, cross-brand comparisons sorted by `ΔE`, and glowing Hex Badges (`CopyHexBadge.tsx`).
- **Performance & Asset Loading**:
  - Dynamically imported `paints_groundtruth.json` in Forge components to reduce the initial bundle size by over ~600KB.
  - Implemented module-level caching for `conversions.json` in `/convert/[conversionSlug]` to prevent redundant parsing.
  - Replaced standard font `@import` rules with `next/font/google` for optimal web font loading.
  - Added `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">` for `framer-motion` to respect OS-level accessibility preferences.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**:
  - Migrated `FeedbackModal`, `ShareModal`, and `AddPaintModal` to Headless UI `<Dialog>` for robust focus trapping and screen-reader support.
  - Increased touch target sizes on `InfoTooltip`, `HexChip`, `CustomDropdown`, and `RecipeHistory`.
  - Added `aria-current` and `aria-hidden` attributes to Navigation icons.
- **UI & Styling Refinements**:
  - Migrated extensive inline styles (e.g. `style={{ backgroundColor: ... }}`) to utility Tailwind tokens across global components and the Forge interface.
  - Changed root background color to `bg-[#050505]` to eliminate white flashes on route transitions.
  - Replaced infinite CSS `boxShadow` pulse animations with performant GPU-accelerated opacity cross-fades.
- **Code Organization (Rules & Skills)**:
  - Consolidating agent behaviors into the `Skills&rules/` directory (e.g. `GEMINI.md`, `Next.js 15 & Tailwind Strict.md`, `architecture.md`, `you-are-a-senior-cheeky-avalanche.md`).
- **Playwright Configuration**: Updated Playwright config to isolate `*.spec.ts` files from Vitest tests.

### Fixed
- Fixed Next.js 15 React hooks purity errors in `ActiveAuspexScan` by properly wrapping `Math.random` generated IDs in `React.useMemo`.
- Fixed `ReferenceError: dataSeq is not defined` missing variable declarations after purity refactor.
- Fixed hydration mismatches in `InventoryHexGrid` caused by nesting standard `<button>` tags within `framer-motion` `<motion.button>` elements.
- Corrected type mismatches in `lib/colorMath.ts` by defining `types/spectral.d.ts` and removing dirty `any` casts.
- Fixed prop inconsistencies between `Forge` page and `AddPaintModal`.

### Removed
- Removed the deprecated and broken `Camera.tsx` component.
- Removed unused UI primitives (`Button.tsx` and `Card.tsx`).
- Removed the outdated "MACHINE SPIRIT AWAKENING" cold-start theatre delay to ungate upload interaction directly upon load.
